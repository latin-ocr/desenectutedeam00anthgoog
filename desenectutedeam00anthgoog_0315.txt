that would have ensued.

In the whole intercourse between Crassus and Cicero may be
observed areal coldness, with occasional alternatione of affected
friendship. In his intercourse with others, Crassus was equally un-
steady in his likings and eumities. They wera, in fact, not deeply
' seated, and, without the practice of much hypocrisy, could be as·
sumed or withdrawn, as temporary expediency might suggest lt
was from motivas of sslf-interest, without actual community offeel-
frigor purpose, that the so-called triumvirate was formed between
Cesar, Pompey, and Crassus. Each hoped ιο gaio the first placa
for himself by using the others for his purposes, though there can
be no doubt that the confederacy was really most profitable to
Cesar, aud that, of the three, Crassus would have been the least
able to rule'alons. Cesar had already found Crassus a convenient
friend; for in B.0. bl, when Cesar was about to proceed to his
province in Further Spain, Crassus became security for his debts to
alarge amount. It may, at first view, excite surprise, that aperson
of so little independent greatness as Crassus should heve occupied
the position that he filled, and that rnen of wider capacity should

considering that the character of Crassus represented, in many
points, alarge portion of the public. While the young, the daring,
and the ambitious, the needy, the revolutionary, and tlre democratic,
adhered to Cesar-while the anstocraoy, the party of the old con·
stitution, those who affected the reputation of high principle and
steady virtus, looked with greater favor upon Pompey-there was
a considerable mass of plain, moderate, practical men, who saw

much that they liked in Crassus. independently of the actual in- Ἰ

fluence which he acquired by the means we have explained, hs had
the sympathy of those who, without being noble, were jealous of

the nobility, aud were rich, or were occupied iu making money. r

They sympathiaed with him because the love of gain was a strong χ

trait in the Roman character, and they saw thal his unsquivccai

success iu his pursuit was a proof of at least one unquestionahla ¹
talant-a talent of the most universal practical utility. He was οοι r

patetic Alexander, hs had gained a moderate proficiency in history
and philosophy. There was no profligaoy in his private conducite
