Senos. In Sparta the senate was called the γερουσία, or Assombly
os Ridere, aud its members γέροντες. The Spartan γερουσία included
the two kings, who were its presidente, and consisted of thirty mem·
bers; and the kings themselves, as far as their votes were con·
cerned, ranked merely as ordinary senators. This will serve to
tbrow light on the expression amplissimum magistratum, which, as ,
employed iu the text, comprehende the hings also-Externa*

. “Things relating to foreign lauds.” Equivalent to historiam eeter-
nom.

tho. “Tell us, pray.’¹ The singular for the plural cedite, just
as we sometimes find age sor agite, asin Cio. pro Lag. Martii, 14:
“Age cero ..... considerate.” The line in the textis taken from
theold poet Navius, and is a comic iambic tetrameter acatalectic,
or octonarius, consisting of four measures, or eight feet. The scau·
ning is as follows:

cedo qui Ι adalram ΙΙ rempubllicdm 11 tantam dimisistllis tom Ι cittii ΙΙ

’ Sic enim percontantur, &a ‘⁴ Forsothey put the question,aswe
frud it in the ‘Ludus’ of Naerius,” ι’. a, for such is the question put
by some of the characters in the comedy of Navius, entitled ‘⁴ Lu-
dos,” or the School. Naevius was one of the early Roman poete,
haring been born somewhere between 224 and 264 B.(). He was
contemporary, therefore, with Cato, though much the older of the
two. Navius oomposed tragedias, comedies, and also an epia poem
on the First Punic War, during the latter part of which contest he
had performed military service.-Proooaiotant oratores noui, dre.
“ There came forth acropus demagogues of low birth, sools, mere
' striplings.” Observa that amiishere equivalent to ignobiles. We
have placed a comma atter stulti, with Madvig and Nauck, which
readers the line a more emphatic one, and produces a species of
parallelism between stulti and adolescentuli. Lambinus, instead of
proveniebant maiorer, gives provehebantur ad rea from a single Ma,
but the line with this change violatas the metra. The verse isa
comic trochaic tetrameter catalectic, in which aooi is tc be pro·
nounced as a monosyllable, as iu Plautus, Mil, iii, 1, ³0:

PrdaZalltbdat 11 (iratiores 11 a'oi ataltli dddidrcllintr'rlli.
