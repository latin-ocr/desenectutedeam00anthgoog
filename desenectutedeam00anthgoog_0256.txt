by Aristode (libet, ii, 13), Diogenes Laertius (i, 87), and others.
(Compare Menog, od Diog. Loert, l. c.)-Impuri cujusdam, dec. “ Of
some sordid wretch, or of some ambitione individual, or of one who

toward Bias. The Grecian sage 'refers merely to ordinary acquaint-
ances, as appears plainly from the words of Diogenes Laertius
which come immediately aller, namely, τοὺς γὰρ πλείστους κακούς,
and also from the following: σονοόοὑλεοέ τε ὧδε. Βροδέως ἐγχείρει

This, again, is an unfair riew of the maxim of Bias. He does not
mean that one is to wish that his friend may prove his enemy, and
thus afford him an opportunity for breaking off, bnt that aman must
