Ι aided (thee), or shall have lightened the care.'' These hexametera
are quoted from theold poet Ennius, who addresses them to Titus
Quinctius Flamininus, the celebrated Romm commender. But
whether hc addressed them in his own parson cr not, and ol what
nature was the distress which is sought to bo allauiated‚ remains a
mere matter ol opinion. Most commentatore suppose that Ennius
utters these verses himself, and that the distress alluded to was oc-
casiqped by tha infamans conduct nithe brother ol Flamininus, who
was expelled in consequence from the senate by cato, at that time
censor, Bc. 184 (Lis, xxxix, 42). Drakenborch, however, thinks
that in the poem ol Ennius, from which th'a lines were taken, they
ware uttered hy Sextus AElius Pctus, the colleague os Flamininus
in the consulship, aud that the trouble aud disquiet ol the latter
arose. from the alerming prodigies which presented lor a period bis
departure from Rome sor the Macedonian war. (compare Lic,
xxxii, 9.) Drakenborch’s opinion appears the more correct one,
Cicero, on the present occasion, applies these same lines to his
friend Atticus, who hed the same praenomen (Titus) as Flamininus,
and whose d'rstress arose from the glcomy state ol public affairs,

, as connected with the usurpaticn of Otasar.

Adjuro. Some editions bara adjucro, bct adjuro, as Drakenborch
remarks, is tha mora correct form, being hy syncope sor adjuvere,
