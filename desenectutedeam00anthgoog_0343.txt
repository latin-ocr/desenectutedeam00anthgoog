noer hc had made the necessary amangements in Africa, aad
annihilatcd an enemy who, though humbled, was still looksd upon

hy Rome with jealousy, Scipio returned to Italy, and entered Rome
in triumph. ln 142 Rc. hc was censor with L. Mummius, and at
this timtol increasing luxury hs fultilled the dutiasos his office
i with the greatest strictness, and without any respect to person or
rank. In the lustrum which he performed at the close of his cen-
sus, he did not pray, as had been customary before, scr the increase
os the republic‚ but only tor its preservation. (Vol. ntae, ir, 1,
10.) lt was, probably, alter his censorship tbat he, together with

, ’ Sp. Mummius and L. Metellus, travelled through Egypt, Syria, Asia,

and Grecos, to look into the state os affairs in those countries.

an obstinate advocate os the privileges os a class, lor we find him
supporting tbc lea Carrio tadelhric against the aristocrats (Cic,
Brut, 25), whence he was considered by some aa a man oi the
