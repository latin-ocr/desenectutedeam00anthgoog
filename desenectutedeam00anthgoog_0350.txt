- 2. The person eddrersed in the prefate, er introduction, ronst be
Pomponius Atticrrs, the friend ol cicero. This is fully proved by t
passage in the life oi cato (aab fin), where we read, “Hejrre de olto
et monbec pluro ξπ ιο libro pereunti morus quern seperatim dr sosaci-
mus rogatu Pomponii Attici,” which is unquestionebly perncuy de·
cisire in so ser es the memoir in which they occur ie eoneerned;
but this, ee we heve seen, was not included in the original edition, ¹
is wanting in some MSS, end, along with the Anime, is separated,
ae it were, from the rest in all

3. The lorty tone in which the grandem end power os the Roman
people ere celebrated, the boldnees os the eomntente on free insti·
tutione end tyrents, would here been totally ont oi place et en epooh
oi degradationem sierery. Allusions, aleo, itis affirmed, rney be
detected to tlre civil wei between Cesar and Pompey. Upon noere-
iul examinationes all the quaetione addueed, itwillbe seen that
no weight ought to be attached to this portion os the proni.

4. Lambinus was insormed, upon what he considered good eu·
thority, that nne MS. ended iu this manner: ‘t completura ert opes
AEre'tii Preti, demtis· Nepotir.” But, eren 11 we admit the eccu-
racy oi a staterum vmched ior eo inperseetly, it leads te no result,
ior the eret clame might be intended to essign the twenty biogra-
phies, the De Regibus, the Hamilcar, end the Haerebat, to Probus,

The question thus started bes given rise to interminabie dhone
sions; but the leading hypotheses may be reduced to three:

· 1. Many ol the contemporaries of Lambinus, unable or unwilling
to abendon the belief in which they bed been reered, and clinging
to the verses eddreseed to iheodesiee, doggedly munerea thet
the old opinion was, eder ull, true; end that ull the hves, except,
perhaps,·those oi Cato end Atticus,·which duod upon somewhet
different ground, were the property oi Probus, end os no one else. .
This position is son very generally abandoned.

. e. Lambinus, es we hare seen, prononnced the hves to belong
entirely tc cornelius Nepos. Thoee who support this hypothesis,
which hae been more widely received rheu any other, hold thet
what we now possess may be regarded eidrer es sportion oi the
volumineus mhectien, De Viris madiae, or es un· independeut
work, which, haring fallen into when, was brought to light by
AEmilius Probus, wito iraudulently endeerored to palm it off ae his
own, or, perhaps, meent to de nothing more then claim the oredit
os haring fflsoovaed and described it ; or, thet the verses in ques·
