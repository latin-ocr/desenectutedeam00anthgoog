The pilot, or steersman, is meant. Ernesti maintains that ipse is
the trus reading, not ille, because it is opposed tc atii. But Cicero
would only have written ipse, it hehad meant the pilot to bc re·

not be disturbed. The case, however, is different with regard ιο·
astera, which appears quite superfluous, and which we have, there-

merely “swittuess,'’ such as is seen in runniug; celeritas, on the
