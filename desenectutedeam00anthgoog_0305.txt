had taken the life ofa citizen uncooderuned and without a trial,
should be interdicted from lire aud water. Gicero here committed
a fatal mistaka. Instead os assuming the bold front of conscious in·
noccnce, he at once took gnilt anto himself, aud, without awaiting
the progressos events, changed his attire, and, assuming the garb
of one accused, went round the iorum soliciting the compassion of
all whom he met.

For a brici period public sympathy was awakened. Α large num-
ber of the senate and the equites appeared also in mourning, aud
the better portion of the citizens seemed resolved to espouse his
cause. ‘But all demonstratione of such feeling were promptly re·
