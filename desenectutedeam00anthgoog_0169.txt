Qum palmam, dac. Compare with this the account given in
Lis, Epir, 49, that when Cato heard of the exploit of the younger
Scipio, who was then seraing as a tribune of thc soldiers, in having
saved the Roman army by his prudence and resolution, he declared
in the Roman senate, ‘⁴ reliquos, qui in Africo militarent, ambros mil·
itorc, Scipionem vigere.’¹- Ut coi reliquias persequare.¹ “Thai you
may follow out what was left unfinished by your grandsire,'’ i. a,
may complete the work which he so happily began, and lay Car-

· thage in the dust. The younger Scipio, as before remarked, was a

*son of L. AEmilins Paulus, but was adopted into the Scipio family
bytho son of the elder Africanus ς the latter, therefore, is here stylcd

which Cicerohas followed-Srdmcmorr'cmillius oiri, drc. lt sounds

the elder Africanus, against whom, according to Plutarch aud other
writers, he cherished feelings of so unfriendly a nature.

The same remark will apply to this emendation as above given. ·

A senato in the carly times was always regarded aa an assembly

the Spartan γερουσία.
