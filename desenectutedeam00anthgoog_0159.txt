“ Cum ec q'aertum comtde adclamatus miles ad Capuam profectus
rum, quintoque aare post od Tarentum quaeror: deinde muts, quodm-
enru'o post sectus sum proetm.'' There is no doubt whatever that
this reading ia corrupt and interpolated, since it is at varianoe with
the accounts both ol ancient historiens aud ol Cicero himself. ln
the first place, Ceto war ,not quaestor at the siege ot Tarentum, bnt
in Μήσας nor under Fabius Maximus, but Scipio Africanus, and,
moreover, so far was he trom being a quaestor at the siege of the
place in question, that he eerred on this occasion merely as a pri-
vate soldier (mites). In the next place, there is no reason whatever
why he should speak of himself, in this passage, as oedile and prte-
tor, when his object is not to make any mention of himself, save

⁸ only so far as will enable him to tell the praises ot Fabius. Again,

he did not fill the proetorship in the year when Tuditanus and Cethe·
gus were consuls, but merely the office of quoestor, a lact ot which
Cicero himself is 'a witness. (Brut, 15, 6.) And, finally, he was not
praetor four years aoerhisedlleship, bulthe very nextyear. We
ought to bave no hesitation, therefore, in rejecting odilis and metor
from the text, with Pighius (Areu. Rom, at ann. cte, p. 21'9), and
by a change of punctuation restoring bis own to Cicero. (Wetzel,

Legis Clinia. The Lea Cincin, called also Muneratc, was passed
in the time of the tribune M. Cincius Alimentus (lic. 204), and not
only forbade a person to take any thing sorbis palus in plcudinga

. cause, but applied also to gists in general, limiting in the latter uase

the amount os what a person could gire, and also requiring such
girls to be accompeuied by oeuain formalities. (Dice. Ant, e. u.)

Ut molescere. “As a young man,'' i. e, with as much encrgy
and spirit as if he were still in early manbood. Observa that there

Et Hannibalem juvenitur enatantem, duo. “ And by his patient pet·
severance calmed down Hannibal, when exulting with all the ardor
os a youthsul conqueror.” Literally, ‘¹ exulting lihe a young man.”
Hannibal was about thirty years os age when he entered ltaly, and
in his sorry-fourth year when be leil that country and returned to
&abege-Familiare aestu. When Cato, who had filled the office
of qusstor under Scipio Africanus in the war against Carthage, was
returning home, he found Ennius in Sardinia, became acquainted
with his high powers, and brought him in his train to ane, where
he ever atter lived on terme os intimacy with Cato and other emi·
