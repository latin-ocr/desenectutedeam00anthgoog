votes os two tribas. (Cio, Phil.. xi, 8.) But, notwithstanding
this* slight, he still possessed great influeuce3 sor when the tribune
Papirius Carbo proposed a law, that the people should be at liberty
to reselect their tribunatus osten as they pleased, the eloquent
speech ot Scipio induced tbe peoplc to reject the measure, though “
it was in their own lavor. (Cic, De An, 25.) Scon after this,
however, a circumstance occurred which called forth the bitterest
opposition os the popular party against him. Scipio had made a
proposition iu favorus the old Italian veterana, which had been ap-
proved othy the senate, aad according tc which, the disputes crisim
cut ot the distributiones the public land should not be decided by
tire distributore, but by other persons. This measure produced a
delay in tire distribution itselt, and the popular leaders, F. Flaccus,
C. Gracchus, aad Papirius Carbo, made the bitterest invectivas
against Scipio in the assemhly, aud called him the enemy oi the
people. When Scipio repeated his approval of the death ct Grac-
chus, the demagogues cried out, “ Down wlth the tyrant !”

Ater these fierce dehates Scipio went quietly horne,·accompanied
by the senate and a great number ot hattus and other allies. ln
the evening he went intubis bed-room with the intention ol writiug
a speech to be delivered the following morning. But io the mont-
ing Scipio wassound dead in his bed (129, B.O.). Aa investigatiou'
into the cause oi his death was prevented by the multitude, and the
event remaioed a secret. Public· opinion pointed out many who
were suspected os having mordered him; as, sor instance, Cornelia
the mother ot the Gracchi, bis own wite Sempronia, and ¹Papirius

Carbo, but the beaviest suspicion sell upon the last-mentioued iu· ' ⁵
