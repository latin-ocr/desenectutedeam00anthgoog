, M. chrrrrns cassans Drvas was the younger son ol P. Licinius
Crassus Dives, who was consul Bt). 97. The date os his birth is
not precisaly recorded, but itis probable that he was born about the
year ΒΕ. 115, lor Plutarch states that he was younger than Pom-
psy (Vir. crasa, 6), and that hewas ruore than sixty years old when
he departed (in the year Rc. 55) to make war against tha Par·

even when successful ; and it was so lar under the control os pusil-
