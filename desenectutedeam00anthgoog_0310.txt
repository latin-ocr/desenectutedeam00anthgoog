’ ih the shoulder hy oue of the gladiatore. The fray now became
general. The party of Clodius were put to ssight, and betook them·
salves, with their laedente ahouse near Bovillae. Milo ordered
his men to attach the house. Several of Clodius’s men were elain, ’
and he himself dragged out and dispatched. The body was lest
lying on the road, till a senator, named Sextus Tedius, found it,
· and conveyed it to Rome. Here it was exposed to the view of the
populace, who crowded to soe it. Next day it was carried nahed to
the soronam again exposed to view before tha rostra. The mob,
enraged by the spectacla, and by the inflammatory speeches of the

tribunes Munatius Plancus and Q. Pompeius Rufus, headed by Sex· ,

tus Clodius, carried the corpse into the Curia Hostilia, medea fu-
neral pile of ibe benches, tables, and writings, aud burned the body
on the spot. Not only the senate-house, but the Porcian Basilica,
erected by cato tha Censor, and other adjoining buildings, were re·
duced to ashes.

Clodius was twice married, first to Pinaria and asterward to Ful·
via. He left ason, Publius, and a daughter. He inherited no
property from his father. Resides what he obtained by less honest
means, he received some moneys by legacies, and hv letting one of
his houses on the Palatino. He also received a considerable dowry
with his wife Fulvia He was the owner of two houses on the
Palatius Hill, aa estate near Alba, and considerable possessione in
Etruria, near Lake Prelins. His personat appearance was effemi-
nate, aad neither handsome nor commanding. That ha was a man
of great energy and ahility there can he little question; still less
- that his character was of the most profligate kind. Cicero himself
admits that he possessed considerable eloquendo.

of Cicero pro Coelio, pro Sextio, pro Milone, pro Domo sao, Da Harus-
picum Rerporrsia ia Pisonem, and in Clodiam at Curionem, and his
Letters to Atticus sod his brother Quintus, Plutarch's Lives of
fi Lucullus, Pompey, Cicero, and (lesan and Dio Cassius. 'Of mod-
ern writers, Middleton‚ in his Life of Cicero, has touched upon the
leading points of Olodius’s history; bnt the best and fullest account ,
hasbeen given iu Drumann's derelicto Roma, vol. ii, p 199-370.
