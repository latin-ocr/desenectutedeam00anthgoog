that be had misgivinga as to the result. Tbe triumvirs had not yet
taken Clodius's side; and when he -impeached L. Calpurnius Piso y
for extortion, their induence procured the acquittal of tha aceused.
But, in defending G. Antonius, Cicero provoked the triumvirs,and
especially Casan and within three hours alter the delivery of his

‚ speech, Clodius became the adopted spn os P. Fonteius. The lex

curiata for his adoption was proposed by Cesar, and Pompey pre-
sided in the assembly. The whole proceeding was irregular‚ as the
sanction os the pontifices had not been obtained. Fonteius, more-
over, was -not twenty years old, and, consequently, much younger
than Clodius, and was married, nor was there the smallest reason
tb suppose that his marriage would remain childless; and, indeed,
he was allerward the father os several children. The rogation, too,

magistrate should observa the beaveris on comitial days, and that
no veto should be allowed to hindar the passing os a law. This en-
actmcnt was designed specially to aid him in the attack with which

ol the old guilds which had been abolished, and tha creatiou of new
ones, by which means he secured the support oi a large number of
organized bodies. A fourth law was intended to gratisy those os
