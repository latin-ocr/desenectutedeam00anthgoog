Μ, Τ. CICERONIS LAELIUS, duc. “Marcus Tullius Cicero’s
Lelos, or concerning Friendsbip.’' This work was written atter
the preceding, to which it may be regarded as forming acompanion.
Just as the dissertation upon Old Age was placed in the mouth ot'
- Cato, because he had been distinguished ior euergy of mind and
body, preserved entire to the very end oi a long lise, so the steadt'ast
attachment which existed between Scipio Africanus the Younger
and Lalius ‘pointed out the latter as a person pecudisrly fitted to

enlarge upon the advantages of friendship, and the mode in which
it might best be cultivated. Το no one could Cicero dedicate such

atreatise with more propriety than to Atticus, the only individual
among his contemporaries tc whom he gave his wbble beart.

The dunginary conversation is supposed to bave taken place be-
tween Lelius and his twc sanein-law, C. Fannius and Q. Mucius
Screvols, a few days aster the death of Africanus the Younger (BD,
129„ and to have beeu repeated in aller times by scevola to
Cicero. Laelius begins by a panegyric on bis friend. Theo, at tho
request os the young men, he explains his own sentimenta with re-
gard to the origin, nature, limita, end valae of friendship3 traces its
connection with thebigher moral virtues, and lays down the rules
which ought to be observed in order to render it permanent and
mutually adveutageous. The most pleasiug feature in this essay is
the simple sincerity with which it is impressed. The author caste
aside the affectation ci learning, aud the reader ieels convinced
throughout that he is speaking from his beart. Iu giving iuli ex·
pressiou to the most amihble feelings, hta experieucs, knowledge oi
human nature, aud sound sense, eneblcd him to avoid all fantastic
exaggeratiou3 and, without sacrificiugbis digniied torte, or pitchiug
bis standard too low, he brings down the subject to the level ci or·
diuary comprehensim, and sets before us amedei which el mal

imitate.
