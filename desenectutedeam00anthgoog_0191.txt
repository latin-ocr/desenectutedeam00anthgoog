'l'here is no philosopher in antiquity who has been soniolently at· ⁵
tached, andwhose ethical doctrines have been samuch mistalren
and misunderstood, as Epicurus. The cause of this singular phaa-
nomenon was partly a superficiei knowledge of his philosophy, of
'which Cicero, for exunple, is guilty to every great extent, and part-
ly, also, the conduct ol men who called themselves Epmumans, and
who, taking advantage os the facility with which his ethbal theory
was made the handmald os a sensual and debauohsd life, gere them·
selvas up to the enjoyment os sensual pleasures. At Rome, apd da-
ring the time of Roman ascendenoy in the ancient world, the phi-
losophy of Epicurus never took any firm root, and it is then and
there that, owing to.the paramount induence of the Stolo philosophy, ,
we meet with the hitterest antagonists of Epicurus. Cato here en·

’ tirely mistakes tho meaning os the term pleasurs in its Epicurean

sense. Pleasure, with Epicurus, was not a mere momentary and
transitory sensation, but he conceived it as something lasting and
imperishable, consisting in pure and noble mental enjuoyments that
is, in ἀταραξία and ἀπονία, or the freedom from pain and from all
intluences which disturb the peace of our mind, and ther'eby our hap-
piness, which is the result of it. The summum bonnm. according to
him, consisted in this peace of mind; and the grean problem of his
ethice, therefore, was to show how it was to ho attained. This,
then, was the meaning ol Epicurus when he maintained that all our
actions ought to have pleasure (penca of mind) as their leading mo-
tivo and aim. (smol, Diet. Biogr, ii, p. 34.)
