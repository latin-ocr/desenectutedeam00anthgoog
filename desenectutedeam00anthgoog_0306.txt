his house on the Palatina, and destroyed his villas at Tusculum and
Formiae. The greater part of the property carried off from them
was divided between the two consuls. The ground on which the
Palatina house stood, with such of the property os still remained,
was put up ιο auction. Clodius wished to beccum the purchaser
of it, and, not liking to bid himself, got a needy fellow named Scato
ιο bid for him. Hs wished ιο ereot on the Palatina a palace of sur-
passing site and magnificenoe. Α short time before this, he had
purchased the house of Q. Seius Postumus, after poisoning the
owner, who had refused to sell it. This itwas his intention to
unite with another house which he already had th'ere. He pulled
down the portico of Catulus, which adjoined Cicero's grounds, aud
ereoted another in its place with his own name inscribed ou it. To
alienate Cicero’s property irretnevably, he dedicated it to the god·
dees Libertas, aod a small portion of the site of the dwelliug, with
part of the ground on which the portico of Catulus had stood, was
occupied hya chapel ιο the goddess. For the image of the goddess
he made use of the statue ofa Tanagrean hetera, which his brother
Appius had brought hom Graece. To maiutaiu the armed bande

whom he employed, Clodius required large siuns of money; but· ·

this hadid not find much difficulty in procuring: for with the pop-
ulace he was all-powerful, and his influence made his favor wortlf
purchasing. He went so far as to offend Pompey hy aidiug the
escape of Tigranes, son of the king of Armenia, whom Pompey had
brought a prisoner to Rome. ln this instance his services were
purchased. Pompey, however, did not feel himself strong enough
to resent the insult. Clodius soon assailed him more openly. The
consul Gabinius sided with Pompey. Frequent conflicta took placo
between the armed baud of the tribune and the consrrl, in ona os
which Gabinius himselfwas wounded and his fasces broken. Glo-
dius and the tribune Ninnius went through the force of dedicating
· ιο the gods, the one the property of Gabinius, the other that of Olo-
dius. An attempt was made by Clodius, through one of his slaves,
upon the life of Pompey, who now withdraw to his own house, and
kept there as long as his enemy was in office. Clodios stationed a
body of men, under his freedman Damie, ιο watch him, aud the “
pretor Flavius was repulsed in au attempt to drive them off.

The attempta made before the end of this year to procura the re·
call of Oicero proved abortire. Next year, Rc. bl, Clodius, pos
sessing no longer tribunitial power, was obliged to depeutl on his
armed hands for preventing the people from passing a decree ιο re-
