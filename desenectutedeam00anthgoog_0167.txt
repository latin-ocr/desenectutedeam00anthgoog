Ι ron (ὀξύμυρον). We have given ths reading suggested by umbi.
- nus, which harmoniaes with the. Greek version ol Gaza. Gruter

and others renuerat e., oica in the ablativa. The common text
os the fragments oi Ennius has amenti sere florere ruina, which
, Gruter very properly condemns. Some editors, und among them
Ernesti, give &mentm rere floreret omitting viai. Others, again,
have &memes sera florere eine, the conjecture ol Scaliger, seta
having the force dimicassemus pecata—Vidi, Observa
the long penult, and consult Antion’r Latin Prorody, p. 19.

Et tumea ipsias Appii, oro. “ And yet the speech oi Appius him·
sels is still extant,” i. a, although the speech itsels os Appius is still
extant. The meaning is this: Even however, if you were not ac·
prainted with the poem or Ennius, yet the extant speech itselswould
put you in full possession oi all the circumstances oi tho uase. “
Plutarch (Vit. Pyrria, 19) gives us tire substance of this celebrated

ogere mononem, notwithstanding the desence usit made by Scheller,
is not good Latione-Septem et mmm onnia, vtro. The time meant
is ΑΜ. 474, ΒΩ, 28⁰, the second consulship of Appius having
been in A.U.O. tte, B.C. 296. 'l'he serenteen years are made up
by including in the computentur, according to the Roman custom,
both the years 280 and 296, or 474 and 458.-Interfuirrrnt. Better
than interflurirsmt, the reading os some editions, which isnot Oice· ·
reniam-Ante superiorem comulatam. His first consulship is meant.
He was elected censorin ΒΕ. ³12, with C. Plautius, without hav-
ing been consul previously, and he held the censorship nntil ΒΩ.
307, when, alter resigning this office, he was chosen consul for the
first time-Grandem Supply matr, or annu. Supposiog that he
obtained the consulship at the legal age (te years), he would he at
the period referred to in the text nearly 7ο years old-Et tumet v

is well expressed by Otto: “ Et, quamquamplane grandis natu erat
