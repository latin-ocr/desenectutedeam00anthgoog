P.Coana1.1ua Semo AEnrtnmnus Arnrcanus Minoa, son os 1,
AEmilius¹ Paulus, and adopted son ot Ρ. Cornelius Scipio (son ot
Africanus the Elder), must have been bom about 1⁸5B.c.; sor in
tae B.O., being theu a youth iu bis serenteenth year, be took a
very active part in the battle oi Pydna, in which hie lether defeated
Perseus, king ol Macedonia. (Iria, xliv, 443 Plan, Vit. AEm. Paul,

among themselves, came forward and declared that he would gladly
accept any post that might be assigned to him. This example in-
spired with courage even those who had hitherto kept back. (laia,
Epit, ta; Polyb, xxxv, 4.) Scipio thus became military tribune
under L. Lucullus. Two heroic deeds oi Scipio in this expedition
are recorded: he was tha only Roman who ventured to accept the
challenge os a hage Spanish chief, whom he slew in single combat.
He was also the first to scale the walls or the town ot Interca-
tia while it was besieged by the Romans. These prooss ol per- ,
aonal courage, and his other virtues, filled eren the enemy with ¹
