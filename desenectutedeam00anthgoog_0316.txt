his own oost. Without the means of doing this, he thought that
no one deserved to be called rich. ln other less stirringtimes he

It was part ο1 the triumviral contract-renewed at nn interview
between the parties in Luca-that Pompey and Crassus should be
a second time consuls together, should share the armies and prov-
