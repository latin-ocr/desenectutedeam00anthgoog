, Ρ. Cronius Procnen was the youngest sou os Apphis Claudius
Pulcher, who in BG. 82 murchad with Sulla against Rome, and
met his death near the city. (Plut, Vir. Sul, 29.) The sorm os
the name Clodius was not peculiar to him, it is occasionally found
in the case os others os the gens (Orelli, Inscripta, 579), aud Clo·
dius was himself sometimes called Claudius. (Dio Gara, xxxv,
14.) He first makes his appearance in history in BG. 70, sarving
with his brother Appius under his brother-indam L. Lucullus, in
Asia. Displeased at not being treated by Lucullus with the dis-
tinction he had expected, he encouraged the soldiers to mutiny.
He then lest Lucullus, aud betook himselsto his other brother-in·
law, Q. Marcius Rex, at that time proconsul in Cilicia, and was in·
trusted by him with tha command os the fleat. He fell into the

hands os the pirates, who, however, dismissed him without ransom, “

through sear of Pompey. He next went to Antiochia, aud joined
the Syrians in making war against the Arabicus. Here, again, he
excited some os the soldiers to mutiny, and nearly lost his lise. He
now returned to Romaand ‘made his first appearance in civil affairs
in Bc. 65, hy impeaching Catilius sor extortion in his governmeut
of Africa. Catilius, however, bribed bis accuser and judge, and
escaped .

ln Bc. 64, Clodius accompanied the propretor L. Murena to
Gallia Transalpina, where he resorted to the most nefarious meth-
ods os procuring money. His avarice, or, the want to which his
dissipation had reduced him, led him to hare recourse to similar
proceedings on his return to Rome. Asconius (in Mil, p. 50, Orcll.)
says that Cicero often charged him with having taken part in the
conspiracy of Catiline; but, with the exception os some probably
exaggerated rhetorical allusione (Dc Harurp. Rerp, 3; prodiit,
14), no intimation of the kind appears in Cicero, and Plutarch (Vir.
Cia, 29) says that on that occasion he took the side ol the consul,
and was still on good terms with him.
