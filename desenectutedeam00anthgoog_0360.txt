passage has given rise to much discussion, and some propose dicta
canoa, “ for form' sake,” iac, in order to get rid of them. The ex-
planation of Van staveren, however, appears most satisfactory, aud

and in that of Cassius, Cyrene. These provinces Dolabella and
Antony had been prerailed upon hythe senate to give ιο Brutus and
Cassius, and Octavianus expressly censured Antony, on a subse-
quent occasion, for bestowing such a recompensa on two of Cesar’s
morderera. (Compare Appion, Ball. Cin, iii, 16.)

orously; hut Decimus Brutus, who defended it, being apprieed of
the approach cf the consuls Hirtius and Pansa, by means of carrier
pigeons‚ made an obstinate resistance. Autony, being defeated
