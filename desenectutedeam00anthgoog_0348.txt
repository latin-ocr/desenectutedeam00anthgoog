Ι Vita T. Pomponii Attici, dec. “Life of'l'itus Pomponius Atticus,
from cornelius Nepos.” Cornelius Nep0s¹ wes tbe contemporary
and friend of cicero, Atticus, and Catullus. He was pmbablya

· antire of Verona, or of some neighboring village, aad died during “

the reign of Augustus. Nc other particulare, with regard to his
persoual history, have been transmitted to us. Helsknowu lohere
written the following pisces, all of which are now lost:

1. Chronica. An Epltome of Universal History, it would appear,
in three books. For the name, eud some ides of the contenta. we
are indebted to Ausonius (Epist, xri), Aulus Gellius (xvii, al, t c,

8, 24), and 8011ιιιιε(1.,)27,ι11ι., t 1); while Catullus, when dedi· -

oetiug his peems to Gemellus Nepos, indicates, though obscurely‚
the object end extent of the productiora in question.

2. Exemplorum Libri, os which Charisius (p. 119, ecl. Perfecit)
quotes the second book, aud Aulus Gellius (rin, 18, t 11) the mn.
This was probably a collection of remarkable sayings aud¹ deiuge,
of the seme description as the compilation subsequently formed by
Valerius Maximus.

³. De Viris Ιὶὶιιιιήὸιιι. Gellius (xi, 8) tells an anecdota of Ceto,
uddiug, “Scriptum eet boe in libro Cornelii Nepotis De illustribus
Viris.’' lt is not impossible that it may be the same work as the
preceding, quoted under a different title.

4. Vite Ciceronis, an error in which is corrected by Aulus Gel-
lius (xr., 28).

c. Epistola ad Glaucone, from one of which Lactantius has pre-
served an extract (Ιιιιιίι. Dte, iii, 15); but we can not tell whether
they were erer formully collected into a volume.

t. Perhaps pcems also, at least he is named in the seme category ,
with Virgil, Ennius, aud Accius, by the Younger Pliny (Ep, ι, c).

7. De Historicie. ln the Life of Dion (c. 8), which now Ιιοιιιι
the neme of Cornelius Nepos, thereisthe‘following sentence: ‘⁶ Sed
