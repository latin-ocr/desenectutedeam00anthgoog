honor, and Crassus with gold. The rullug passion ol Crassus was
avarioe; and, to repair and increase the fortunas os his family, he
was willing to submit to servile dependence, to encounter any risk,
and undergo any bardship. He undertock a service of considerable
danger in levying troops sor Sulla among the Marsi, and he aster-
ward (lto. 83) distinguished himself in a successful campaign in
Umbria. He was personally bravo, and by fighting against the
remeius os the Marian fection he was avenging the wrongs ol bis
house. Sulla put him in mind ol this, and rewarded him by dona'·
tions os confiscated property, orby allowing him to purchase, at an
almost nominal velue, the estates os those that were proscrihed.

os being rich, liked to liare the power ot purchasing vulgar popu·
larity, and prized the luind ol intluenoe which the capitalist acquires
over the debtor,and over the man who wenta to borrow or hopes
to profit. To these objects the administration os civil affairs and
warlike command were, in his view, subordinate. He possessed
very great ability, and steady industry in obtaining what he desired,
and soon began to justisy his bereditary sumams Dives. He ex·
tended his influenoe by aeting as an advocate before the courts, by
giving advice in domestic affairs, by canvassing sor votes in laver
