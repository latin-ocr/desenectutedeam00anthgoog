as some maintain, nor to a “ 1ίιιιιω,” as Gerrhard ternis it. We
have not hesitated, therefore, to adopt clcgcica, the reading of Bil-
lerhech⁴ (Compare Becker, Oie. Crit, p. 49; Jcn. Lieerz, 1820, p.

1513 Heidclh Jahrb, 1826, p. 9, 88.) The lines of Solon, to which
Cicero alludes, are as follows:

Mad· ipoi ἄκλαυστος θάνατος μόλοι, itti φίλαισι
hohi-cinopo θανῶν ἄλγεα κρῖ στοναχάς.

Cicero gives us the following translation of them in his Tusculan
Disputations (1., 49):

“ More area ac carcat leopario: linquamus amicis
Mororcm, ut celebrent funera cum gemitu.”

&duca acinon, dcc. ⁴⁴ Ennius perhaps, however, (has express·
ed himself ) better.” As regards the form of expression houd acio
an, which is intended to denote uncertainty, but with an inclination
in favor of the affirmative, consult, as before, Zumpt, d 354, 721,
and with melius supply dixerit, or cecinerit. The more literal trans-
lation will require, in our idiom, the negative to be supplied with cn, ’
“ I do not know, however, whether Ennius may not have expressed
himself hetter.”-Ncquc funcra fictcscxit: “Nor celebrate my fu·
neral obsequies with weeping.” observo that facit is the old form
for feccrit. (Zumpt, t 161, note.) This same quotation is given ina
fuller form in Tuec. Βίῳ, i., 15.

Scaeua monendi. ⁴¹ Perception of dying,’¹ The idea intended to
be conveyed by the whole clause is as follows: the act of dying
may, indeed, he attended with a sense of pain, but it is e pain, how· ,
ever, which can not be of long continuance, &n The true reading
here is mmcodr', not morienti, as Ernesti and Wetael maintain-Aut
optandm. “ls either desirable‚'' i. c, is either something that a
good end pious man ought to wish fen-Sine quc meditatione. Com·
pare Tusa. Βίῳ, 1., 30, επις iii, 16; Seme, dc Vir. Brea, c. 7.-
Ee c'd incertum, cn, dcc. “ And, perhaps, this very dey.” Literally,
“and thie is uncertain, whether (we are not to die) onthis very
day.'’ The expression inceium cet aa falls under the same rule ae
laod scio an. (Censuit mmsrhs on houd scio aa in t 73, and Zumpt,
t auen-Animo emittere. “ Be of firm mind.”

Non L. Brutum. url'hat not Lucius Brutus alone.” Observe c

that noa ltere, and also in the clauses that follow, is equivalent to
