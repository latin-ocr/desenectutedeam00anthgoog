ιο extreme danger on their march through san‘dy deserte, where
they would he unable to procura water and provisions. Crassus,
however, determined to march through Mesopotamia, and engaged
Artavasdes ιο supply him with auxiliary troops'3 hut tlre king never
sent the promised forces, excusing himself on the ground that they
were necessary for his own defence against Orodes. ¹

Crassus, iu p'ursuingthe imprudent course which he determined
upon, was misled hy a crafty Arabian ehieltain, called, hy Plutarch,
Ariamnes3 hy others, Augarus, or Abgarum, or Acbarus. This
Arah had formerly served under Pompey‚ and was well known ιο
many in the army of Crassus, for which reason he was selected hy
Surenas to hetray the Mmaos. He mered himself as a gulde to
conduct them, hythe ehortest way, to the enemy. He told the no-
man general that the Parthians durst lrot stand before him; that
unless he made haste they would escape from him¹ and roh him of
the fruita of victory. Cassius, the legate, suspected Ariamnes of
treachery, and warned Crassus, instead of following him, to retire
to the mountains; hut Crassus, deceived hy his fair words and foel-
ed hy his mttery, was led by him to the open plains of Mesopota
mia. Ariamnes, having accomplished his obJect seized afrivolous
preterit, and rode off to inform Surenas that the Roman army was
delivered into his hands; and crassus soon learned from his scouts
th'at the Parthians were adrancing.' The conduct of crassus in
this emergeney wasmarked hy irresolution. He first drew up his
infantry in line, and placed his cavalry on the wings; an arrange-
ment which would hare obviated the murderous success of the Par·
thian arcuere, and would have prerented the troops from being out-
tlanlred hy the Parthian horse; hut he then altered his mind, and
formed the infantry in a solid square, flanlred hy squadrons of cav-
alry. Το his son he gave one wing, to Cassius the other, and
placed himself in the centre. In the battle that ensued the Par·
thians exhibited their usual taetics, advancing with· territis shouts
and the colse of lrettle-drnms. They worried the densely-marshal· .
ed Romarm with showers of orrows and jevelius, every one of which
struck its man. Crassus was disheartened at finding that there was
no chance of their missiles heing emeritense a· number of camela
were laden with a lorge supply. By teigned retreats, during which
they continued to discharge their arrows, they led the Romans into
disadvantageous positions3 then they. suddenly rallied and charged,
while the enemy were in disorder and blindcd by dust.

amors, and misfortunes, and unffilling bravery, we must refer to
