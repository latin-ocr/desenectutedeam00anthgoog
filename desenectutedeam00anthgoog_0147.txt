lt is held that old age is wretched ε l. Because it incapacitates uren
for active business; 2. Because it rendere the body feehle; 3. Be-
cause it deprives them of the enjcyment of almost all pleasures; 4.
Because it heralde the near approach cf death. 'l'he first three are
met by producing examples of ruany illustrioris personages, iu whom
old age was uot attended by any of these evils; hyarguing that such
privaticns are,nctreal,-but imaginem, miefortunes; aud that, it the
relish for some pleasures is lost, other delights of a more desirable '
and substantial character are substituted. The fourth objectron is
encountered still more holdly by an eloquent declaration that the
chief happiness of old age, in the eyes of the philosopher, arises
from the conviction that it indicates the near approach os death,
that is, the near approach cf the period when the soul shall be re·
leased ¹from its debasing connection with the body, and enter un·
lettered upon the paths of immortality. This pisce bas always been
. deservedly admired as one of the most graceful moral essays be-
queathed to us by antiquity. The purity cf the language, the live-
liness of the illustratione, the dignity ef the sentimenta, and the ’
tact with which the characteres the strong-minded, hut sslf-satistied
and garrulans old ruau is maintained, have excited universal ap·
plause. But, however pleasing the picture here presented tc us,
ι every one must pereeive that it is a fancy sketch, aot the faithful
copy cf a scene from nature. ln fact, the whole treatise is a tissue
of special pleadinp, cn a'qusstion which is discussed iu the same
tone of extravagance, on the opposite side, by Juvenal in his tenth
satire. The logic, als0,isbad; forinseveralinstances general prop·
ositions are attached hya sewspecious particular cases, which are
mere exceptione to the rule. No one can doubt the truth of the aa·
senibus, that old age dces incapacitate us foractive business, that
it does render the body feehle, and that it dces blunt the keenness
cf our senses; but, while it is a perfectly fair styla of argument to
maintain that these ure imaginary and uot real ills, itis utterly ab·
surd to deny their existence because hbury atiords a few instances

Cicero appears to have been indebted for the idea, if not the plan
of this work, to Aristo of ceos, a Stnic philosopher (c. ι); much,
however, has been translated ιιιιιιοει literally from the Republic
of Plato (compare chapters a, 8, rt), and more freely from the
OEccncmics aud Gyroptediaof Xenophon. Tha passage with regard
tutha immortality of the seul is derived from the Timauo, the
Phaedon, tha Phedrus. and the Menum aad some editors bavo
