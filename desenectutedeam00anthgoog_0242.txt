aliod quoddam filum,⁸ dsc. “But the style and spirit of your own dis·
course is a different thing of its kind,” i. e, your mode of handling
the subject is avery different thing from theirs. Supply eet with
filum. Gernhard reads quoddam eet fitam at once. Other editors,
as, for example, Ernesti and Schutz, have quoddam expetimus filum,
und others, again, expectamus. Our reading is that of Orelli and
Madvig-Ie tortia Scipionis, dcc. Compare chap. iv, t tt. - Qaea·

asyve glean from Lactantius and St. Augustine, contained apro-
tracted discussion on the famous paradoxas Carneades, that justice
was a visionary delusion. L. Furius Philus advocated on that oc·
cesion·the doctrine ef Carneades, and Lelius opposed it.-Goatra
decoratam arationem Ptttt. “Against the elaborate discourse of
Philus.'’ The epithet mauretus, in accordance with its etymology,
is properly applied to things on which great care and labor have
been expeuded.—Quidamicittaml “Whatofdefendingfnendship'l”

laW,” ι’. e, of two such esteemed relatives as you are—Propter
imbecillitatem, &c “On account of the wealrness and wants of
man.” This is the Epicurean view of the subject, namely, that
friendships are to be formed with reference tu the utility to be de-
rived from them. Such, also, in later days, was the opinion of
Rochefoucault: ‘⁶ Ge quc lca hommes cot nomme* amitic‘, m’cst qu'ome

scaled, and a nobler, and a different motiva originating iu our very
nature itself.”-—Prittcepc. “The leading motive.”-Al iis. “l-*rom
