't; Bell. Juu, i., 8) gives a circumstantis] account oi the plnndcr
of the Temple at Jerusalem by Crassum but the narrative is not free
irem suspicion, lor Jerusalem lay entirely out of the route od Cras· g
sus, and was at a distance uos between four hundred end live hund·
red Roman miles from the winter-quartem ol the army; and we
believe that no historiari hut losephus mentions the occurrence, it'
we except the author ol the Latin work ⁴¹ De Bello Judaeu’ (i, al),
which is little more than an enlarged translation os Josephus, and
pasees under the name of aegesippus· Το the Divina judgment
for bis sacrilege on this occasion, Dr. Prideaux (Consentes, part 2)
attributes the subsequere infatuaticn of Crassus. According to this
aeneum, Eleazar, treasnrer of the Temple, had, for security, put a
bar ol gold, os the weight ol three hundred Hebrew minae, inte a hol·
lowed beam, und to this beam was attached the veil which separa-
ted the Holy Pisce from the Holy ol Holies. Perceiring that Grae·
sus intended to plunder the Temple, Eleazar endeavured to cem-
pound with him, by giving him the bar of gold on condition that he
would spere the other treaaures. This Crassus promised with an
cath; bnt had no sooner recalved the gold, than he seized not only
two thousand 'talents in money, which Pompey had leh untcuched,
bnt every thing else that he thought worth carrying away, to the
velue os eight thousand talents more.

Orodes (Arsaces XIV.), the iringus Parthia, was himself engaged,
with part cs his army, in an invasion ol Armenia; but he dispatch·
ed Surenas, the most illustrious of his nobles, and a young, acccur-
plished general, into Mesopotamia with the rest ol his forces, ta hold
crassus in checlr. Before proceeding to hostilities, he sent am·
bassadors to Crassus, to say that, is the Roman general made war
by the authority os the senate, the war could only terminate by the
destruction ol one or other ol the parties l but hattho prompting
os his own desire, the iring would talre compassion on his old age,
and allow him tn withdraw his'trcops in safety. Crassus replied
that he would give his answer at Seleucia. “Scenae” said the
ambussador, Vagises, “shall hair grew on the palm oi this hand
than thy eyes behold Seleucia'' ¹ Artavasdes, the king of Armenia,
requested Crassus tc jola him in Armenia, in order that they might
oppose Orodes with their united forces, he pointed out to the Ro-
man general that, Armenia being amountainous country, the cav-
alry, os which the Parthian arrny was almost entirely compared,
would there be useless; and he promised to take care that in Ar·

. menia the Roman army should be supplied with all necessarias.

ln Mesopotamia, on the other hand, the Romans would be exposed
