CHAPTER VIII.

’ Melius Oaenlins, dre. “Caecilius has expressed this aentIment
respecting an old man (thus) exercising roresight ior the benedt os
a coming age in a better spirit than (he), the same (poet), has that
other one‚” i. e, the line'whioh we have just given from Oaeoilius
Ι Statius respecting the old man planting trees for another generation,
is eonceiued in a much better spirit than that other passage from
ihc pen of the same poet, namely, dio. With Goefflins supply hoc
dixit or something equivalent-AEdepol, aeneam, doc. “Depend
upon it, old age,” dac. There must be a comma aller senectus, as
this isan address to age. The lines here quoted are frome play
of Statius entitled ‘¹ pinensi as 'we'learn ¹froin Nonius' (a. o. odoe-
m're). The measure l's lambio trimeter. ln the first line edepol is
pronounced ase' dissyllable, and sorms a spondee; and in the third
dio becomes 'a monosyllable‚ forming the latter hals os a spondee:
