ward, he assaulted Cicero himself, aud compelled him to taire refuge
iu a neighboring house. Next day he attached the house of Milo,
situated ou the emineuce called Germaius, but was driven off by Q.
Flaccus. When Marcellinus proposed in the senate that Clodius
should be brought to justice, the friends of the latter protracted the
discussion, so that uo decisiou was made. ’
Clodius was at this time a candidate forthe edueship, that, it
successful, he might he screeued from prosecution; and threatened
the city with tire aud sword if au assembly were not heldfor his
electiori. Marcellinus proposed that the senate should decree that
no election talre place till Clodius had been brought to trial. Milo
declared that he would prevent the consul Metellus from holding
the comitia. Accordingly, whenever Metellus attempted to hold an
assembly, he posted himself with a strong body of armed men ou
the place oi meeting, and stupped the proceediugs by giving notice
that he was observing the auspices. ln the beginning of the schow-

clodius, almost immediately atter his electiou, impeached Milo for
public violence. Milo appeared on the second uf February to an-
awerthe accusation, and the day passed without disturbance. The
next hearing was used for the uinth, and when Pompey stood up to
defend him, clodius's party attempted to put him down by raising
a tumult. Miio's party acted in asimilar manner when Clodius
spoke. A fray ensued, and the yndicial proceediugs were stupped
sorgthat day. The matter was put od', by several adjournmeuts, to
the beginning of May, from which time we hear nothing more of it.
Iu April, Clodius celebrated the Megalesian gamas, and admitted
such a number of slaves that thefree citizens were unable to find
room. shortly aiter this, the senate consulted the haruspices ou
some prodigies which had happened near Rome. 'lhey herdred,-
that, among other things which had provoked the angerus the gods,
was the desecration of secred places. Clodius interpreted this as
