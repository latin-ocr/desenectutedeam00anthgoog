280 excussus 1.

Toward the close of B.C. 62, Clodius was guilty of an act of sac-
rilega which is especially memorable, as it gave rise ιο that dcadly
· animosity between him and Cicero, which produced such important
consequences to both and tc Rome. The mysteries of the Bona
Dea were thie year celebrated in the house chaesar. Clodius, who
had an intrigue with Pompeis, Caesar‘s wife, entered the house,

with the assistance of one cf the attendants, disguised as a female .

musician. But while his gnide was gone ιο appriae her mistress,
Clodius was detected by his voice. The alarm was immediately
given, but he made-bis escape by the aid of the damsel who had
introduced him. He was already a candidate for the qnoestorship,
and was elected ; bnt in the beginning of BC. 61, before he set out
for his province, he was impeached for this offence. 'lhe senate
referred the matter to the pontifices, who declared it an act of im·
piety. Under the direction oi the senate a rogation was proposed
to the people, ιο the effect that Clodius should be tried by judices,
selected by the praetor, who was to preside. The assembly‚ how-
ever, was broken np without coming to a decision. The senate
was at first disposed tp persist in its original plan; but afterward,
on the recommendation oi Hortensius, the proposition nithe tribune

that he was with him in Rome only three hours before he pretended
to have been at Interamna. Bribery and intimidation, however,
secured him an acquittal, by a majority of thirty-one ιο twenty-five.
Cicero, however, who had bean irritated by some sarcastic allusione
made by Clodius ιο his consulship, and by a verdict given in con-
tradiction to his testimony, attached Clodius and hie partisans in
the senate with great vehemence.

Scon aiter his acquittal, Clodius went to his province,'Sicily‚ and
intimated his design of beccming a candidate forthe aedileship. On
his return, however, be disclosed a different purpose. Eager to re·
venge himself on Cicero, that he might be armed with more formi-
dable power, he purposed becoming atribune of tbe plebs. For this
it was necessary that he should be adopted into a plebeian family;
and as he was not in the power of his parent, the adoption had ιο
take place by a vote of the people in the Comitia Curiata. Repeat·
ed attempts were made by the tribune C. Herennius ιο get this
brought about. Cicero, who placed rellance on the friendship and
support of Pompey, did not spara Clodius, though hc at times shows
