Nam quibusdam, quor audio, deo. The philosophera here referred
to are probably the Epicuream. A similar sentiment is expressed
in the Hippolytus oi Euripides (v. 153, sequ), but there the poet
evidently means it as a mere piene 'or' Soeratie irony. The Stoio
' Chrysippus, who filled his writings with quotations from Euripides
and Homer, and who very probably cited this very passage ol tho
Hippolytus in bis worlr περὶ φιλίας, is thought by Valckenaer to be
here copied by Cicero. (Voleb, Diania, p. 28, req.)—Quod illi nea
persequuntur suia argutiis. ‘⁴ Which that nation do not bunt aster
with their sophistica] subtleties.'’—Nimiaa amicitias. “Strong
friendsbips.” We must notrefer nimias here to number, but merely
to quality. cicero’s niuno amicitie are direotly the reverse os the

referred to. They who refer nimias to number are misled by plu·
