iards than his avaricious general, Lucullus, 'was able ιο acquire.

(Appiae, vi, ct.) The year following, 15⁰ Bc, Scipio was sent

hy Lucullus to Africa, ιο request Masinissa to send a number oi

elephante over tospaio. He wos most honorably received. Mas·

inissa and the Carthagioiaus were just preparing ior battle ; Scipio ·
beheld the contest srorn err eminencsr and as soon as the cacha·

moinus were apprised oi his presence, they entreawd him ιο act as

mediator between them and Masinissa. But he was not able to ei-

iect what they wished, and he returned to Spain with the elephanto.

When the war between Oanhagc and Rome brohe ent, scipio,
then still military tribune, went ιο Anien, end here, egeln, distin·
gnished hiinseli so much by his ceurage, prudenee aad iustice, thei
he not only gained the unlhnited confidente ci his own ceantrymea ⁴
and Masinissa, but even oi the Carthaginiens, who trusisti ne ltn-
mau but Scipio. Roman ambassadors‚ who were sent to the camp
in Africa to report orr the state ol affairs, orr their return tc Rome
, were unbounded in their preise oi Scipio and oi the attachment oi
the soldiers to hirrr. (Appiae, viii„ ae, dre.) ln 148 Rc, when
the consul Calpurnius Piso undertcolr the command ia Africa,
scipio returned ιο Rome, where every body appears to hare been
conrinced that he alone was able ιο complete the conquest cl Otr·
thage. Cato said thet Scipio alone was alive, while all the other
generals were ruere shadows. (Iste, Epic, 49; Polyb, rixari, ι.)

Scipio was a candidate ior the edileship, he was unanimously elect
ed consultor the year 147 Β.Ο., though he had not yet atainei the
legitimare age: he obtained Africa ior ils province. On his return
to Africa hc was acoompanied by Polybius and Lelius3 and imme-
diately aiter his arrival he saved a considerable body oi Ῑιοιοοιι
soldiers, who had penetrated inte one oi the suburbe oi carthago.
(Appiae, viii, 11³, dre.) He restored discipline in tire Roman army.
liis first operation was ιο cut cil all supplies, which the Carthagin-
ians had hitherto received from the interior oi Africa, and in the
following winter (147-146 BD.) he eucoeeded in taking Nepheris,
whence the Carthaginien, till then, had received their supplies· by
eea. His command oi the army was prolonged ior the year 146
Β.Ο., and irr the spring os this year he made his attach upon the
city, which was defended with the utmcst despair, arrd by a decree
nithe senate he raaed it ιο the ground. He is said ιο have wept ”
orer its ruins, aad to have uttered the prophetie words oi Homer,
as applicabit ιο his own native city (rt, vi, 448, ceph: ⁰
