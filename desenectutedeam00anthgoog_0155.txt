Gratissimum nodis, duc. “ Yon will have done a very acceptabis
service to hoth'or' us, that Ι may answer sor Scipio also.” As Laelius
was the elder, his age gave him this privilege. 'Ihus we heve in
the “De Amicitia” (c. 9) the following language frcrn Fannius:
“ Tu uero perge, Lcli5 pro lucc enim, qui minor eet natu, meo jure re-
spondeo.’'-Volumus quidem certe. “We wish, indeed, at least.”
Observe that nolumus has here rhetores os decideramus—Ingraves-

usual form os construction would be qua nubis quoque ,ingredienda
