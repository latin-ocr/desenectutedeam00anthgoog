Multa peccantur. “Many criffnes ere committed.” Cicero bere

deviates from the principle laid down by him, and is obliged to re·
turn to what he calls popular opinion. The murder of a slave, and
an act os parricide, both proceed equally from asingle impulse ol

versus pronuntiatus est, doc. The actoris nothissed lor any negli-
gent pronunciation 'ol tire line, but the line itsels is hissed, and the
ector as the representative ol the poet. Hence we beve the norn-
inative with the passive verb, not si oneum pronominum-Omni
gestu moderatior. “More caresully regulated than eny theatrical
gesture.’'-Aptior. “ More exact.”- Tu ct in syllaba te peccasse di·
